<h1 id="header-1"><a href="#header-1"></a>Leaflet.SelectFeature</h1>
Plugin that selects feature(s) by drawing an area on the map

This plugin let the user draw an area on the map. As a developer you can get the layers that are within the bounding box of that area. Once you have the instances of the layers you can manupulate them separately.


<h2 id="header-2"><a href="#header-2"></a>Usage</h2>

Include Leaflet.SelectFeature in your JavaScript project using `npm install leaflet-selectfeature`.

You can then include Leaflet.SelectFeature in your web application by adding the following HTML tags (paths below are relative to your project's root):

...
<script src="./lib/js/Leaflet.SelectFeature.js"></script>
...

Put it after leaflet is loaded.
Once your page is loaded you can easily use it by enable it like:

var selectfeature = map.selectFeature.enable();

After the plugin is enabled the user can draw an area by holding the left mouse button and start drawing. You can disable the plugin by:

selectfeature.disable();

Than the mouse events for drawing stop working with the map.



<h3 id="header-3"><a href="#header-3"></a>Options</h3>
The following options are available with SelectFeature (showing you here with the default settings):

<dl>
  <dt>options{</dt>
    <dd>color : "green",</dd>
    <dd>weight : 2,</dd>
    <dd>dashArray : ' 5, 5, 1, 5',</dd>
    <dd>selCursor : 'crosshair',</dd>
    <dd>normCursor: ''</dd>
  <dt>}</dt>
</dl>  

You may modify the options once the plugin is enabled by, for example;

  selectfeature.options.color = '#663399' ;
  selectfeature.options.weight = 1 ;
